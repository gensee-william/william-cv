                                    <p>Community Radio Refugee Week 2019 Global Media Project
                                        I worked as a content creator and producer on a series of stories. I created 1x 30 Minute Radio piece, 1 x5 Minute Radio piece and 5 x 1 Minute radio pieces. This project is a collaboration with refugee/migrant/asylum-seeking and undocumented communities in Europe. The project had 40 broadcasting partners in Europe. The underpinning of this project was learning 21st-century skills along with digital storytelling skills.
